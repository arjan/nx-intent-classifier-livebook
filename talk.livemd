The embeddings server is a python program that runs on the following URL:

```elixir
server = "http://localhost:5000/encode"
```

```output
"http://localhost:5000/encode"
```

The Python repo for it is [located on Github](https://github.com/arjan/embeddings-server-ref). 
Lets try out the embedding server:

```elixir
bytes = Req.get!("#{server}?q=Hello+world").body
```

```output
<<158, 9, 215, 60, 46, 121, 91, 60, 227, 138, 148, 187, 244, 131, 178, 188, 212, 113, 95, 61, 165,
  189, 162, 187, 119, 23, 218, 59, 209, 227, 250, 60, 183, 214, 188, 187, 228, 124, 149, 187, 202,
  36, 89, 187, 16, 164, 70, 189, 53, 48, ...>>
```

Lets put this data into a Tensor

```elixir
bytes |> Nx.from_binary({:f, 32})
```

```output

Okay, so that works, we can make a tensor out of a sentence. In the next part we are going to extend this to translate a list of annotated sentences into an array of vectors with their corresponding labels.

Lets transform it into a list of labels and a list of sentences:

```elixir
{labels, utterances} =
  "disco.json"
  |> File.read!()
  |> Jason.decode!()
  |> Enum.flat_map(fn %{"id" => id, "training_data" => training_data} ->
    training_data |> Enum.map(&{id, &1})
  end)
  |> Enum.unzip()
```

```output
{["faq_about", "faq_about", "faq_about", "faq_about", "faq_about", "faq_about", "faq_about",
  "faq_about", "faq_about", "faq_about", "faq_about", "faq_about", "faq_about", "faq_about",
  "faq_about", "faq_purpose", "faq_purpose", "faq_purpose", "faq_purpose", "faq_purpose",
  "faq_purpose", "faq_purpose", "faq_purpose", "faq_purpose", "faq_purpose", "faq_about_us",
  "faq_about_us", "faq_about_us", "faq_about_us", "faq_about_us", "faq_about_us", "faq_about_us",
  "faq_about_us", "faq_about_us", "faq_about_us", "faq_about_us", "faq_about_us", "faq_address",
  "faq_address", "faq_address", "faq_address", "faq_address", "faq_address", "faq_address",
  "faq_address", "faq_address", "faq_address", "faq_address", "faq_address", ...],
 ["tell me something about yourself", "what are you", "i want to know everything about you",
  "i want to know about you", "why are you here", "I want to know you better", "describe yourself",
  "talk about yourself", "explain what you are", "what is this exactly", "are you a chatbot",
  "i want to know more about you", "can you introduce yourself", "please introduce yourself",
  "tell me about yourself", "what is the purpose", "i want to know what your purpose is",
  "what is the idea?", "what do you need from me?", "what is the reason for your existence?",
  "what do you want from me?", "can you tell me what your purpose is?",
  "what is the purpose exactly?", "what is your purpose?", "what is the idea with this",
  "more details on this project", "i have a question about the company", "about the project",
  "tell me about your company", "can you tell some more about you guys", "what do you guys do",
  "give me more information about your game", "i'm looking for more information about your company",
  "who made this project", "who made this game", "who are the builders of this project",
  "who are the creators of this game", "where are you based?",
  "what is the location of your company?", "can you tell me the address of your company?",
  "can you tell me the address?", "what's your address exactly?", "where are you?",
  "in which country are you guys based?", "where are you guys located?",
  "on what address is your office?", "on what street is your office?",
  "what is your office address?", ...]}
```

First of all, the labels. We want to encode these as numbers instead of text labels, and make them into a tensor.

```elixir
lookup = labels |> Enum.uniq() |> Enum.with_index() |> Map.new()
labels_tensor = labels |> Enum.map(&lookup[&1]) |> Nx.tensor()
```

```output
#Nx.Tensor<
  s64[197]
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, ...]
>
```

Let's also save the number of samples:

```elixir
n_samples = Enum.count(labels)
```

```output
197
```

Now, lets convert the utterances to a tensor. We do this the same way as before, but now with a POST method to the embeddings server because we are encoding many sentences in one request:

```elixir
body = utterances |> Enum.map(&{:q, &1}) |> URI.encode_query()

headers = %{"content-type" => "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}
data = Req.post!(server, body, headers: headers).body
```

```output
<<244, 141, 20, 58, 120, 17, 172, 60, 118, 112, 107, 60, 160, 41, 106, 188, 187, 186, 2, 60, 43,
  248, 3, 60, 27, 143, 218, 188, 169, 179, 124, 189, 54, 107, 237, 188, 100, 101, 170, 188, 105,
  212, 113, 61, 199, 137, 248, 60, 95, 4, ...>>
```

... and make it into a tensor again, shaped accordingly:

```elixir
Nx.from_binary(data, {:f, 32}) |> Nx.reshape({dim, n_samples})
```

```output
#Nx.Tensor<
  f32[768][197]
